  Cavern Number: 335-04
  Project Number and Name: Project 2 and Asqwilanga Cavern
  Team Name and Members: GOOS, Anthony Goossens
  
  Intro:
      So, this is a an algorithm visualization task.  Specifically, your task is to display the steps (and state of progress) in a search to find a path from an extremal cave room to the “most-central” cave room of the great Asgwilanga Caverns, which consists of a number of cave room subsystems with cave rooms connected by directional causeways (i.e., the causeways allow travel only in one direction, typically by a big jump off a descending section ledge across a fallen gap – for which some blame the grey wizard).
      My program unfortunatly doesn't showcase the steps in a 3D platform. It doesn't pause so that functon is not in this program, sorry. This program comes with a custom field so the user can input a custom coordinate for the cave start.
      The algorithms used are a simple loop that checks for duplcates and max coordinates list. This can all be seen in the index.js file with all the functions and loops.

  Setup and Installation:
      Download the Project 2 Folder and drag into your support browser and run the html file.
      
  Features:
      Fast and accurate cave exploration that shows all the steps in finding said path. Does not feature a 3d or 2d colored map the 
      exploration.
